Worked Examples of Deploying ZOWE and Associated Tools.

## Imagine...
* Imagine having a beautiful browser-based graphical user interface to perform a wide range of Db2 z/OS Database Administration work tasks. 
* In addition to the Db2 Catalog of Db2 objects, there is a Catalog of APIs to provide callable database services that can be re-used by multiple integrated tools.
* And all of this can be provided from services running in z/OS, without needing to deploy any clients or servers outside of z/OS.

## ZOWE offers
Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS similar to what you may experience on cloud platforms today. 

The home of ZOWE is at [www.zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/)

ZOWE is an opensource framework for z/OS that provides a core set of applications out of the box in combination with the APIs and OS capabilities future applications will depend on.

IBM is developing a new range of tooling for Db2 that runs in ZOWE. This tooling offers a productive browser interface
