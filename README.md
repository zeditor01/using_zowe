# Using ZOWE
Worked Examples of Deploying ZOWE and Associated Tools.

## Imagine...
* A productive browser-based graphical user interface to perform a wide range of Db2 z/OS Database Administration work tasks. 
* A Catalog of APIs to provide callable database services that can be re-used by multiple integrated tools.
* All provided from services running in z/OS, without needing to deploy any clients or servers outside of z/OS.

## ZOWE offers:
Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS similar to what you may experience on cloud platforms today. 

The home of ZOWE is at [www.zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/)

## IBM offers:
A growing range of zowe-based tools for Db2 z/OS, based on the IBM Unified Management Server for z/OS, and the IBM Db2 Administration Foundation.

## This github repository offers:
A structured set of worked examples for using the zowe-based DB2 tooling, at the pages linked below....

## Step 0 : Start with z/OSMF
The starting point on your ZOWE journey is a fully functional z/OSMF service. Most sites should have this up and running already, because it is the recommended vehicle for installing software from ShopZ.
